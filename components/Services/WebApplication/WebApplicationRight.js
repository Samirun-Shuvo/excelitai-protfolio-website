            <p>The term, web application development means a whole range of distinct services that include
                enterprise and customer research, architecture planning, design wireframing and prototyping,
                frontend and backend coding, optimization, maintenance, DevOps, and a lot more. Web app
                development services help people discover more about a company: know the services and
                products it provides and contact the sales team that ultimately boosts the sales. It also helps
                them interact with various solutions, such as catalogs, order forms, videos, and so on.

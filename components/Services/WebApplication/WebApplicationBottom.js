                    We, Excel IT AI, maintain the proper web application development process. We implement Agile,
                    Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall Models. As the Agile Framework gives the best outcome, we
                    recommend your application to be developed with the framework. Here is the development
                    process we follow.

                <h6>1. Requirement Analysis</h6>
                <p>
                    To begin with a project, we determine the problem you wish to solve. Then our team prepares a
                    proposal for the best possible solution for your project. The proposal includes detailed project
                    plans and SRS.

                <p>
                    After the clientsâ€™ approval, we start working on the project. Our designers and developers initiate
                    with the basic wireframes to establish the systematic organization or the blueprints of the
                    application. In this phase, we prepare mock-ups to display how graphics, texts, and other
                    elements fit the structure of the custom web application.

                    This is the phase to create the UI/UX design and prototype to develop an interactive demo of
                    the application. At this primary stage, you can test the viability of the app through MVP which
                    lowers your time and budget. Architecture Planning and Prototyping also develop the
                    architectural basics of the app.
